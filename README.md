# Stocks
Implemented multiple statistical models on 30 stocks from 6 different industries to come up with the minimum risk and optimal portfolios and to forecast betas 

# Models implemented:
1. Equal Allocation Model
2. Single Index Model With and Without Short Sales
3. Multi-Group Model With and Without Short Sales
4. Constant Correlation Model
5. Markowitz Model

# Analysis performed:
1. Found the composition of optimal protfolio for each of the above models
2. Plotted every obtained portfolio (from the above models) on the space expected return against standard deviation
3. Drew efficient frontier using both hyperbola and two-points method along with tangency points (modified it every time          according to the composition obtained) 
4. Forecasted betas using both Blume's and Vasicek's techniques and computed the PRESS
5. Produced a time-plot of the performance of all portfolio when compared to S&P 500
6. Calculated the Sharpe Ratio, differential excess return, Treynor measure, and Jensen differential performance index for        each portfolio
7. Decomposed the overall evaluation using FAMA's decomposition for using Single Index Model to find the return on 
   selecitivity and return on risk
8. Used Monte Carlo similations to calculate the 99% 5-day VaR for the single index model no short sales allowed scenario
